The Onyx1 project is the beginnings of a teaching simulator for assembly language programming
and the beginnings of an operating system.  When complete, we'll have a CPU, Semi-virtual memory manager
(page management, but no swap yet), System calls, coprocessor calls, I/O handlers, a monitor and an assembler.

Future wishlist would be things like

- A high-level language that compiles to this processor (maybe something like Monkey or Small-C)
- A debugger
- Add in swapping
- Add in basic, inefficient multi-tasking :-)
- GUIs
- Doc books (This is for teenagers who are learning)
- ANY OTHER STUFF YOU THINK I SHOULD HAVE, or ANY STUFF YOU KNOW I DID WORNG AND YOU CAN DO BETTER!
  I am not proud!  If you way "What idiot wrote this code!!", I am that idiot and am more than willing to
  be shown how the pros do it!

The entire project is under creative commons and can be freely used for any non-commercial or education purpose.
For commercial contact me, and we can work something out as I will send all funds to Onyx's and his schoolmates.

Who is Onyx?

Onyx, is (currently), a 12-year boy in West Africa.  I have been sponsoring his education.
While he may not find this his cup of tea (he is far more interested in aeronautics), I've learned, at least
in that West African country, no money, no secondary education, no exceptions.  And don't even think about a
university education unless you wealthy.

I grew up with privilege.  My parents were not wealthy by any means, but they believed in education and fostered it.
I received my first very primitive computer at age 15.  (SWTP 6800 for those legacy systems like me), and more important, someone
who was willing to sit down and teach me since it was not my parent's forte.  I learned assembly language (because what
else can use in 16KB (Kids?  I said KB, not GB....) of memory.

My hope is that these tools will give these students what their schools cannot.  If you think you want to join in,
this project is available to all -- you don't even have to speak Efik!  (Though it would be cool if someone translated it.)
Use it in your own school or give it to another young kid.  (Because you can't become Dr. Frankenstein without a little help.
And don't complain about Dr. F.  He was misunderstood.  If he were alive today, he'd have received VC funding, the monster
would be Qi charged, and Starbucks would have a new barista... you know it's true don't you!)

-- From the guy who desperately tried to explain to his parents what he did for a living.  I just gave up and said
   "I just push buttons and money comes out the other side..."  They were satisfied with that.
