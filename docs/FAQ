+Why did you use Linux as opposed to Windows/Mac/Atari 400/The Coding System of the Ananaki/etc.*

Well, two reasons.  First, I think Linux is a better base -- everything is documented, after a fashion.
You can learn it from anywhere, material and free training are eaisly obtained.
No matter where you are, or what your resources are, you can get it.  Other things cost money, and
many of the users of this system simply do not have excess money.
Also, Linux runs on nearly anything, from big cloud servers to little Raspberry Pis.  Anyone can get
hardware to run this on.  And you don't need to pay for upgrades because the Marketing department has
to sell something (COUGH Windows 11....)  Granted, the Linux airplane is assembled out of a variety of parts,
with a variety of controls, some of which actually work, but it's better than the Windows and Mac airplanes which
eitehr blow up unexpectedly, or, they fly, but someone insisted they be so thin, you can only have one isle of seats.

No, it won't take over the desktop, but it can run on anything else....
